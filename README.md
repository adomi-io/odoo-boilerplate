# Adomi-io - Boilerplate Odoo


Odoo is an open-source ERP platform that bundles common business apps (CRM, Sales, Inventory, Accounting, HR, Manufacturing, and more) into a single system.

This repository is a starter template for getting up and running with Odoo quickly. 

Clone it, add your custom addons, to the addons folder, configure your instance, and you're ready to ship Odoo

> [!TIP]
> Upstream image source code
> [adomi-io/odoo](https://github.com/adomi-io/odoo)
 

> [!NOTE]
> Adomi is an Odoo partner and consulting company. We release open-source tools
> and utilities. This boilerplate will you started with Odoo quickly. 
> Feel free to fork this project or make it your own.


# Highlights

- 🚀 **Fast local setup**: Docker Compose stack ready for development.
- 🧩 **Addons-first workflow**: Mount your project addons into the container with a predictable path.
- 🔧 **Config you can ship**: Keep Odoo config and environment values separated and portable.
- 🪝 **Hooks support**: A place for startup/install scripts that run when the container boots.
- 🧱 **Easy image extension**: Add Python deps, extra addons, or Enterprise without fighting Docker.

# Getting started

> [!WARNING]
> This project is made to run via Docker.
> If you’re on Windows or macOS, install Docker Desktop:

## 1) Clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adomi-io/boilerplate-odoo.git
cd boilerplate-odoo
````

## 2) Configure environment

Copy the example `env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update values in `.env` as needed (db credentials, ports, etc).

## 3) Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Odoo should come up on the port defined in your compose/env (commonly `http://localhost:8069`).

## 4) Logs + shell access

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

```bash
docker compose exec odoo /bin/bash
```

# Project layout

* `addons/`
  Your custom Odoo addons live here.

* `config/`
  Odoo config files you want to mount into the container.

* `hooks/`
  Startup/setup scripts (auto-install modules, bootstrap config, etc).

* `extra_addons/` (optional)
  Extra addons you want to bake into a downstream image or mount separately from `addons/`.

* `docker/` (optional)
  How to run your project from ghcr using Docker Compose.

# Using this boilerplate in development

## Addons workflow

1. Create or copy addons into `./addons`
2. Restart (or upgrade the module inside Odoo)

Typical restart:

```bash
docker compose restart odoo
```

## Debugging

If you’re using the Adomi Odoo image as your runtime, you can also use it as a development environment.
See the main image repo for IDE and breakpoint setup patterns:

* **[adomi-io/odoo](https://github.com/adomi-io/odoo)**

# Extending the base image

Most real projects need at least one of these:

* Python dependencies
* Enterprise addons
* extra addons baked into the image
* default config baked in

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/adomi-io/odoo:19.0

# Install Python dependencies (example)
# USER root
# RUN pip install stripe
# USER 1000

# Copy project addons into the image (optional, if you don’t want to mount)
# COPY ./addons /volumes/addons
```
# Notes on Enterprise

If you’re an Odoo Partner (or have GitHub access), you can clone `odoo/enterprise` into the project
and either mount it or bake it into a downstream image.

If you’re not a partner, you can download Enterprise from Odoo and place it in a folder in this repo
(keep licensing in mind, of course).
